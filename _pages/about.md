### About

I am a PhD student enrolled at Technical University of Munich, currently employed at some_place. I am simulating various applications in urban mobility since 2017. In my PhD, I am diving deep into the impact of 5G and Beyond on Urban Mobility. When I say deep I mean it, because I am developing a [new simulator called Disolv](https://disolv.dev) to support my studies. You can read all about it in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1145/3615979.3656062).

I will be sharing my research journey on this site, mostly professional highlights. My socials are at the bottom of the page.

#### Past Work

I was at TUMCREATE, Singapore before enrolling at TUM. I worked on an amazing high-performance [traffic simulator called CityMoS](https://citymos.net). I modeled the taxi behavior into CityMoS to assist simulation of the entire Singapore with electric tranportation system. [The project is a huge success.](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/news/tumcreate-researchers-recognised-contributions-singapores-2040-vision-all-vehicles-run-cleaner)

Prior to that, I was at NTU where I worked on coupled simulation platform built with MATLAB, PTV VISSIM and ns-3. I joined in the second-half of the project and contributed towards improving the ns-3 codebase to support large-scale evaluations for Truck Platooning, GLOSA etc. Another project was about investigating the interactions between electric scooters and pedestrians.
