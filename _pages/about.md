### About

I am searching for a developer role in C++ or Rust.
I am an urban mobility researcher with expertise in developing simulation tools for urban mobility research. 
Specifically, I like working in the connected vehicles studies at city scale.
I have extensively used C++ and Rust in my work so far.
As a part of my doctoral thesis work, I have developed a [new simulator called Disolv](https://disolv.dev).
More details are found in my research articles.

My scholar profile, github and socials are at the bottom of the page.

#### Past Work

I was at TUMCREATE, Singapore before enrolling at TUM. I worked on an amazing high-performance [traffic simulator called CityMoS](https://citymos.net). I modeled the taxi behavior into CityMoS to assist simulation of the entire Singapore with electric tranportation system. [The project is a huge success.](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/news/tumcreate-researchers-recognised-contributions-singapores-2040-vision-all-vehicles-run-cleaner)

Prior to that, I was at NTU where I worked on coupled simulation platform built with MATLAB, PTV VISSIM and ns-3 to support large-scale evaluations for Truck Platooning, GLOSA etc. I have also worked on investigating the interactions between e-scooters and pedestrians.
