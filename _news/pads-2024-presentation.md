I presented my article ["Simulating Data Flows of Very Large Scale Intelligent Transportation Systems"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3615979.3656062) at the ACM Sigsim PADS (Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation) 2024 conference held in Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA. In this article, I describe an open-source, highly scalable, and customizable VANET simulator called [Disolv](https://github.com/nagacharan-tangirala/disolv).

Conference attracts the key experts in the field of simulations. The amazing group of people that I met at the conference includes [Prof. Cai Wentong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QdmIiyIAAAAJ), [Srikanth B. Yoginath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ao2Is9IAAAAJ), [Philipp Andelfinger](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=ZjKlg28AAAAJ), [Alessandro Pellegrini](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=lrxSz_0AAAAJ).

Disolv is the resultant of a collection of decisions that are aimed at making the VANET simulations simple and scalable. This enables a plethora of use cases where the performance is preferred over fidelity. Now that the idea is validated, I am carrying out experiments using it and potentially write up articles using the amazing results. 

This is my first article from a series of articles that will potentially appear soon as a part of my work towards PhD dissertation. Stay tuned!
