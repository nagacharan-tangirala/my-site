The regular article submission titled **"Analysis of Heterogeneous Fleets with Autonomous and Human-driven Vehicles"** is accepted for presentation at [ITSC 2024](https://ieee-itsc.org/2024/). This is a work carried out with the help of a Bachelor student as a part of the thesis. In this study, a driver behavior model is designed and implemented in an open-source [Fleet Management and Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand simulator called FleetPy](https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy). Through the model, it is possible to realistically include the human-driven vehicles in the fleet simulation. This opens up possibilities to explore Fleet concepts such as designing Heterogeneous fleets with a mixture of Human-driven and Autonomous Vehicles. 

By allowing extensive parameterization, the model answers the questions such as: 
 - What happens if drivers are enforced to work daytime only, while the autonomous vehicles work during the nights?
 - What happens if the drivers contain a mix of Internal Combustion Engine vehicles and Electric Vehicles?
 - What is the income loss due to the introduction of Autonomous Vehicles?
 - How many drivers are replaced by the gradual introduction of Autonomous Vehicles?

A study is carried out in the paper to answer the last question from the above list. More details in the article!
