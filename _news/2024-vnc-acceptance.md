A poster about the simulator Disolv is accepted for the poster session at the [IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1003110/all-proceedings), 2024. This is an amazing platform to introduce the simulator to the VANET simulation audience. The poster presents a statistical analysis showing how good the performance is at a negligible expense of deviation in the results.
