I presented my article "Optimizing Very Large Scale ITS Applications With Fast Fitness Evaluation" at WCNC 2025 held in Milan, Italy.
This paper demonstrates the application capabilities of Disolv for high-performance simulations.
This is my second article from a series of articles that will potentially appear soon as a part of my work towards PhD dissertation. Stay tuned!
