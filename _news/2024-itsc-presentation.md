The regular article titled **"Analysis of Heterogeneous Fleets with Autonomous and Human-driven Vehicles"** is successfully presented at [ITSC 2024](https://ieee-itsc.org/2024/). The conference is held at Edmonton, Canada. This is a work carried out with the help of a Bachelor student as a part of the thesis. In this study, a driver behavior model is designed and implemented in an open-source [Fleet Management and Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand simulator called FleetPy](https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy). Through the model, it is possible to realistically include the human-driven vehicles in the fleet simulation. This opens up possibilities to explore Fleet concepts such as designing Heterogeneous fleets with a mixture of Human-driven and Autonomous Vehicles.

Unfortunately, due to the visa issues, none of the authors could make it to the conference. Hence, we had our presentation session through zoom.
