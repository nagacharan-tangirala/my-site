The regular article titled **Integrated Simulation of Federated Learning for Large Scale Intelligent Transportation Systems** is accepted for presentation at Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC) 2025 conference.
In this article, we explain how a simplified VANET simulator can be efficient to study large-scale VANET applications that are computationally complex. 
To demonstrate this, we consider the study of Federated Learning (FL) in VANETs and demonstrate the new modeling approach.
Moreover, we also consider the agent-like behavior of vehicles in the study of FL algorithms, which is essential to tackle the future of 5G and Beyond.
