Blackboard pattern is a very complex architecture pattern.
It is often used when there are no straightforward solutions to a complex problem with dynamic inputs.
This is more of an algorithm to solve some not-so-well defined problems.
The development complexity is too high and might take years to develop a reasonable solution.
Personally speaking, this is not a highly recommended pattern to use.
I have added this for the sake of completion.
